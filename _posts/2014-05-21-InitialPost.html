<h2>Welcome to My Portfolio Blog</h2>
<p class="well Lside">I would just like to take a minute to say how grateful I am to whomever may be reading this. This is the first time I have ever kept a written blog journal or kept track of my professional development in an organized fashion. Over the next several years, I hope to learn and develop my skills as both a coding enthusiast, as well as an organizational specialist. Both subjects are of great importance to me and I hope that the readers of these entries will take part in my passion for these topics also. </p>
